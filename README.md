REM -------------------------- Ducky Description -------------------------------------

~


This Ducky Script was originally written for use with the Flipper Zero's bad USB feature.

This will unlock both a windows 10 and 11 machine that is configured with a windows KMS server 

If your machine is not pre-configured with a KMS server your machine may search for a KMS server over the internet

These public KMS Client Keys are provided by Microsoft, but they only work if your system can contact a KMS server.

~

~

- If you upgrade from Windows 10 to 11, your existing KMS activation will carry over.
  
- If you enter a Windows 10 KMS key on Windows 11, it will still work normally (as long as you have access to a KMS server).
  
- The KMS activation period (180 days) and reactivation process remain exactly the same.

- Youre machine will reach out to the KMS server every 180 days to confirm KMS key validity.

REM -------------------------- Potential Security Risks -------------------------------------

If your Windows machine is not pre-configured to connect to a local KMS server Your Machine might connect to a totally random third party KMS server

The third party server might be logging activation requests, tracking devices, or injecting malware.

the third party server could be collecting system info, sending it to unknown entities.

If the third party server goes down, your activation will expire in 180 days.

REM -------------------------- Legal Risks -------------------------------------

Microsoft blacklists unauthorized KMS servers regularly.

Using third-party KMS activations violates Windows licensing agreements.
